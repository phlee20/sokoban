# sokoban

A remake of Sokoban using LÃ–VE2D plus a level editor to make new levels.

### A note about the level editor
I designed the level editor as a learning exercise and to help me add levels to the game quickly. Current implementation is not deployable as it does not save directly to the game or load existing levels. Levels are also not validated before saving and thus will crash if levels do not meet the requirements of adding a player, closing off walls and matching the number of boxes to dots. Future update may fix this feature to be user-friendly.
